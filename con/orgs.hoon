::  orgs.hoon [UQ| DAO]
::
::  manage an organization on-chain
::
::  this contract is designed to emit updates to a %social-graph.
::  NOT FOR DAOs! DAOs should be self-governing. orgs.hoon allows
::  users to create user-controlled organizations. control of the
::  org is delegated to an id, which can be a multisig contract,
::  some person's address, or something else entirely...
::
::  why not generic? one likely wants to subscribe to events from
::  one contract per organization. in the future, watching events
::  associated with one item in particular could be easy, in which
::  case, can genericize this easily.
